h1. Welcome to our SHack

*SHack* is what happens when you put together _The Fast Version Control System_
"Git":http://git-scm.com/ with "Eric Meyerâ€™s Simple Standards-Based Slide Show 
System":http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/ offspring, "S6":https://github.com/geraldb/s6

A *SHack* is a *Git* version controlled set of *Steps*, where each Step comprises
a set of *Slides*, and the matching *Source Code*. Or in other words, a code-centric
presentation, where your slides and your source code hold their hands and walk
together for your happines :)

Each *Step* is a Git *Branch*, _yes_ a Git *Branch*, named following a numeric 
secuence, like:

<pre><code>
$ git branch 
  001-Hello
  002-Generate_a_Rails_base_application
  003-Add_a_Resource
* master
</code></pre>

The Slides are simple "Textile":http://redcloth.org/textile/ tagged text files
living inside the special @slides/@ folder. For each *Step* (branch) there is a
matching *Slide* named in the same way, in this case:

<pre><code>
$ ls  slides/
001-Hello.textile
002-Generate_a_Rails_base_application.textile
003-Add_a_Resource.textile
</code></pre>

*SHack* gives you the tools to build, manage and navigate this structure, 
generating the associated *Slideshow* with the HTML, CSS & JavaScript (JQuery) 
mix provided by "S6":https://github.com/geraldb/s6

At any moment of your presentation, course or workshop, you will have both the
exact slides and the code in its matching state. Isn't your life much better now?

Also if you are using "GitHub":https://github.com/, your *SHack* can be forked 
at any time to allow people to contribute in a controlled manner, or just update 
it to the latest versions of the always evolving technologie you are using.
